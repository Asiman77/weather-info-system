# weather-info-system
 This is my Django project about a weather information system. It displays current temperature, humidity, and sky conditions using data from OpenWeatherMap. I also created the HTML and CSS. I truly enjoyed working on this task and found it a great choice for starting. Successfully running the program was a delightful moment for me!
